# Sandbox e-commerce system

Project to practice programming skills, microservices, and various technologies and frameworks. 
This project will involve using technologies such as Kubernetes for container orchestration, Docker for containerization, 
messaging systems for communication between microservices, and a variety of data storage solutions (e.g. SQL databases, NoSQL databases) to handle product and customer data. 
Additionally, services will use API design best practices to expose microservices through a set of RESTful APIs, 
and networking concepts such as load balancing and service discovery. 


## Possible services

Here are some examples of features and services that this system could include:


### Product catalog service
This service could handle all the data related to products, including product information, pricing, and inventory. 
It could be built using a SQL or NoSQL database and expose a set of RESTful API endpoints for querying and updating product data.

### Order management service
This service could handle all the data related to customer orders, including order history, order tracking, and payment processing.
It could be built using a SQL or NoSQL database and expose a set of RESTful API endpoints for querying and updating order data.

### Customer service
This service could handle all the data related to customers, including customer information, order history, and personalization. 
It could be built using a SQL or NoSQL database and expose a set of RESTful API endpoints for querying and updating customer data.

### Recommendation service: 
This service could be responsible for providing personalized product recommendations to customers, based on their purchase history, 
browsing history and other related data, it could use machine learning techniques.

### Image service
This service could handle image storage and delivery for products in the catalog. 
It could use a distributed storage solution such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

### Search service 
This service could handle product search functionality, allowing customers to search for products by keyword, category, or other criteria. 
It could use a search engine such as Elasticsearch.

### Cart and Checkout service
This service could handle the functionality related to shopping cart and checkout. 
It could include features such as adding and removing items from the cart, calculating taxes and shipping costs, and processing payments.

### Front-end service
This service would handle the presentation of the e-commerce platform, including the website and mobile apps. 
It could be built using a JavaScript framework such as React or Angular.

### Authentication and Authorization service
This service would handle user authentication and authorization. It could use a third-party service such as Auth0 or Okta, 
or be built using an open-source library such as OAuth or OpenID Connect.
